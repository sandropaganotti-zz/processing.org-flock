This a Processing.org (http://processing.org) program that simulate the behavior of a flock
of objects (e.g. sheep). You can adjust the flock center at runtime 
by using W,S,D,A keys.

For more information about flocking visit:
- Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)
- SandroPaganotti.com (Italian): http://sandropaganotti.com/2009/01/01/uno-stormo-con-processing

This program also works with the amazing Processing.js (http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/) library by
Jhon Resing. 

This application is randomly inspired by a very well made tutorial about flocking 
and VB6 (http://www.vb6.us/source-code/simulate-flock-objects-vb6-source-code-sample)

=== CONFIGURATION ===

These are the options you can change to tweak this program:

int canvas_width  = 400;
int canvas_height = 400;
int min_separation = 15;
int circle_size = 5;
int num_sheep = 100;
int max_noise = 250;
int mint_follow_x = 0;
int mint_follow_y = 0;
int follow_amount = 100;
float max_speed_variance = 0.001;
float min_speed = 0.005;
float max_speed = 0.01;
